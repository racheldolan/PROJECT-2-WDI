# GA WDI-34  Project #2: A Full-stack Application
## Canvas

For our second project we had a total of 7 days to build a full-stack RESTful application using Express and EJS which includes authentication.

I built Canvas, a community driven site for artists to share their work and discover other artists across mediums for collaboration, inspiration and to showcase their skill.

 ### The Build

My first project taught me the importance of planning as thoroughly as possible in order to avoid scope creep, especially as this was my first experience of building a full-stack application.

I wanted to build an app that allowed users not only to discover art but to discover other artists, so it was key for users to be able to see each other's profiles and to be able to showcase anything they posted on their own profile.

In order to do this I had two models - one for "pictures" (art) and the other for users. This project was the first time I used Virtuals in order to populate a user's profile page with pictures they've posted, which was one of my highlights of this project.

 ### Learnings

Despite planning a lot more for this project than my previous project, I underestimated how long it would take to reach MVP, meaning that some of the features I'd planned (e.g. having the ability to "like" or "favourite" posts from other users), I was unable to implement due to time constraints.

 ### Extra Features

Moving forward there are a few features that I think would be good to add.

* Allow users to follow other users - number of followers/following displayed on profile
* Users can "like" a particular post which will then appear on their profile
* Error messages displayed to the user - e.g. at login, trying to comment without being logged in.
